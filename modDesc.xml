This mod gives you control over food effectiveness, crop assignments, mixed feed recipes, and TMR compositions.

Notice: 
- This mod is in beta. Please back up your savegames before use.
- Customizations are done by editing an XML file generated in your savegame folder. No in-game UI is provided.

Customize aspects of animal feeding without modifying map files:
- Add custom food groups to animals and custom ingredients to mixtures/recipes
- Disable unwanted food groups or ingredients (except Grass)
- Adjust food effectiveness (productionWeight, eatWeight)
- Change which crops belong to each food group (fillTypes)
- Modify mixed feed recipes and ingredient proportions
- Customize TMR/forage recipe compositions and ranges

Limitations (what this mod CANNOT do):
- Cannot disable the Grass food group - causes game hang. You can change its weights.
- Cannot delete or add new animal types (only modify existing animals like COW, PIG, CHICKEN, SHEEP, HORSE)
- Cannot delete or add new mixtures/recipes (only modify existing ones like PIGFOOD, FORAGE)
- Cannot change consumption types (SERIAL vs PARALLEL)
- Cannot change internal names or titles (these are used for matching only)

Usage:
- Configuration file (aaf_AnimalFood.xml) is automatically created in your savegame folder on first game save.
- Exit the game and locate the XML file in your savegame directory.
- Edit the XML to customize your animal feeding system.
- Changes take effect on every savegame load as long as the mod is active and the XML file is present.
