This mod gives you control over food effectiveness, crop assignments, mixed feed recipes, and TMR compositions.

Notice: 
- This mod is in beta. Please back up your savegames before use.
- Customizations are done by editing an XML file generated in your savegame folder. No in-game UI is provided.

Customize aspects of animal feeding without modifying map files:
- Food effectiveness (productionWeight, eatWeight)
- Which crops belong to each food group (fillTypes)
- Mixed feed recipes and ingredient proportions
- TMR/forage recipe compositions and ranges

Usage:
- Configuration file (aaf_AnimalFood.xml) is automatically created in your savegame folder on first load.
- Exit the game and locate the XML file in your savegame directory.
- Edit the XML to customize your animal feeding system.
- Changes take effect on every savegame load as long as the mod is active and the XML file is present.
